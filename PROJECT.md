<h4>Project Summary</h4>

This project aims to unite a homebrewing fermentation chamber with a mobile-ready frontend application. The project will consist of a frontend app written in React Native, a web-server built in node.js, PostgreSQL and Mongo databases, and a Raspberry Pi that will act as a control unit.

The essence of the project seeks to connect the workings of a fermentation refrigerator with a control unit and an application for adjusting fermentation temperature dynamically.

<h4>Target Audience</h4>

The project hopes to serve homebrewers by providing insight into the lifecycle of a batch. Users will be able to not only receive information on the batch in progress, such as the current temperature and time in fermentation.

These outputs will be displayed on a mobile-first frontend application that will allow the user to review past data, change temperature settings, and log brew history.
