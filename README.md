## Group Members
+ Amy Conchie
+ Veronica Moreno

## Project Description
+ Users explore a virtual garden environment in Unity3d.
+ Most of the environment is created using scripting in C#
 + Cellular automata
 + Genetic algorithms
 + Procedural generation
 + Fractal generation

## Who uses it?
+ Nature lovers
+ Adventurers
+ Math people
+ Biologists
+ Gamers
+ Grandmas

## What outputs do they need?
+ Observe forumulae present in nature
+ Be able to plant seeds
+ Watch environment change over time
+ Experience environment expansion/generation with procedural logic

## What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
+ User must explore the environment
+ User must take action to plant seeds

## What technologies will you use that weren't covered in class?
+ Unity 5
+ C#

## What technologies do you plan to use?
+ Unity 5
+ C#
+ AngularJS or React for site hosting project

## Feature list

### Base Goals
+ A randomly generated garden environment users can explore.
  + Perlin Noise
  + Procedural landmass generation
+ Users can observe plant life
+ Users can login to web site hosting project on webgl

### Next Stage Goals
+ Users can interact with plants
  + Removing
  + Planting

### Reach Goal
+ Plants exhibit 'genetic diversity'
  + genetic algorithms
+ User can take 'photos' (screenshots) and save in a 'notebook'
  
### Dislocated-Shoulder-From-Reaching Goal
+ Plants have chance to 'genetically mutate' adjacent plants
+ More elements in environment
  + trees
  + structures/'buildings'
  + NPCs
