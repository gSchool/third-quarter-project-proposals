## Project Description
Our idea is for a match making service that pairs farmers and the produce theyâ€™re offering with local consumers. Our hope is to make a useful tool that can help independent producers find a demand efficiently, while promoting a conscious approach on the side of the consumer.

## Who uses it?
Farmers with produce (of any kind) to offer. Consumers looking for a particular product.

## What outputs do they need?
What farmers are offering what products and the means with which they plan to provide them i.e. Delivery, Pick-up, or market meeting.

## What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
Forms for submitting means and offerings on the part of the farmer. The ability to make a profile for a particular farmer. Possible GPS though that hasn't been decided.

## What technologies will you use that weren't covered in class?
Meteor, Ionic, and Mongo via Mongoose.

## What technologies do you plan to use?
HTML
CSS
JS
Auth (tbd)
Google Web Services (tbd)

## Feature list
Profile Page for farmers
Authentication for Farmers and Consumers
Private Messaging
Public Wall Posts
Endorsement Feature (tbd)
