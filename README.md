## Group Members

"Austin" + "Sandy" + "Spencer" + "Kyle" === "Team Discovery Channel"  

## Project Description

An IOS app that offers drink pairing suggestions from Drizly inventory based on user inputs with the goal of integrating with Drizly api to have the suggested beer/wine delivered to the user. We haven't decided if we want to focus on beer or wine yet.


## Who uses it?

The target group is people already using prime now/drizly/peach whatever delivery service that need suggestions for beer/wine.


## What outputs do they need?

At minimum a recommendation for a suitable beer or wine, ideally we would also initiate the order for the user and have it delivered to them but this is contingent upon permission to use the Drizly api.



## What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?

The app will begin by asking the user if they want to pair their wine or beer with food and continue asking the user multiple choice questions to narrow the choices until a suitable product has been selected.  


## What technologies will you use that weren't covered in class?

Swift


## What technologies do you plan to use?

1.Swift
2.Javascript
3.Express
4.PostgreSQL
5.NodeJS
6.Xcode



## Feature list
+User Login and profile that persists and stores preferences, past purchases for the user.

+Simple interface that allows users to quickly get an appropriate recommendation for beer or wine in < 10 questions.

+Integration with Drizly for immediately ordering the recommended product

+Integration with wine.com/breweryDB.com api if the user would like more information on their selection.

+Ability to receive another similar recommendation with the same constraints if the the user does not like the first recommendation for whatever reason.

+Soooper Fun facts to _delight_ and _entertain_ the customer displayed whilst using the app.
