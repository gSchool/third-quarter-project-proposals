## Project Description
An app for indecisive and curious people to find interesting dishes to eat. Will take into account dietary restrictions, hit food APIs, give people a selection of dishes, hit a food business API, then provide a map pointing to restaurants that serve desired dish.

## Who uses it?
Indecisive people and couples ("What u wanna eat babe?" "Idk what u wanna eat??" "i dont know") foodies looking for new unknown dishes, people looking for restaurants they might not know about.

## What outputs do they need?
They need to be presented with food dishes filtered by selected dietary restrictions, so they won't see things they can't eat, and they can choose what interests them, then they get a map telling them where to go to a restaurant.

## What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
Dietary restrictions, and location.

## What technologies will you use that weren't covered in class?
Swift, Xcode, Alamofire, Cocoapods, Firebase backend,

## What technologies do you plan to use?
Swift 3.0, Xcode8, GoogleMaps API, FoodSource API, Geolocation, possibly Yelp API, Alamofire, Apple AppStore.

## Feature list
Easy choose dietary restrictions for more than one person, game-like wheel of fortune spinner to randomly select a dish that matches diet restrictions, map showing locations of user and nearest restaurants serving desired dish.
