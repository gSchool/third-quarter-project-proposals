## Project Description

This project (name TBD, but we are contemplating "Danny-Bird") is an application for bird watchers (Danny), hikers and outdoor enthusiasts, designed to maximize user education about surrounding wildlife during outdoor experiences.  Our project will allow a user to search for bird calls heard in their area using the the Xeno-Canto API and geolocation and match these sounds to what they here in real time to identify wildlife.  

## Who uses it?

Everyone, but especially Danny.  
Users will include bird enthusiasts, hikers, educators, scouting groups and family groups - anyone who wants to make an outdoor experience even more interactive and educational.

## What outputs do they need?

Users (Danny) will be able access bird sounds based on their current location.
Users (Danny) will be able to access of silhouettes of birds previously heard in their area.
Users (Danny) will be able to access detailed classification information about the birds they have encountered.

## What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?

Input of user location will provides the listed outputs.  Users will be able select and filter the provided information.  Auditory matching will be determined solely by the user.

## What technologies will you use that weren't covered in class?

React Native/JSX as the front-end framework/view controller.
We will be developing with XCode and cocoapods.

## What technologies do you plan to use?

HTML5
CSS
JSX
React Native
Node
Express
Mongo
PhyloPic: an API for animal silhouettes
Xeno-Canto:  an API for for bird sounds from around the world
HTML5 Geolocation API
Twitter API
Pivotal Tracker

## Feature list

MVP:
A user will be able to log in with Twitter.
A user will be able to input their location and receive a list of birds.
A user will be able to play the sounds of each bird in their area.
A user will be able to select a bird and receive more information about that bird:  name and image.
A user will be able to add a bird's name and location to their personal experience list.
If no matches are heard, a user can navigate to xeno-canto to submit a new bird and location to the database.

Stretch:
A user will be able to use Twitter to tweet their location and what bird they heard, along with a link to the xeno-canto site.
Integrate a gallery of photos from image sources tagged with the species name when a bird is selected by the user.
