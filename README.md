## Project Description
Location-based reminders application. When you enter a reminder, you tag it with a location. When you enter or exit that area, it will notify you!


## Who uses it?
People who want to be reminded of things and want to learn to do other things good too!

## What outputs do they need?
They need an interface to see their current reminders. Also, to ensure that we properly saved a new reminder. Also, they need to be notified properly when they are supposed to be.

## What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
A location tagged with the reminder, and current location data.

## What technologies will you use that weren't covered in class?
We are planning on releasing a Swift app, as well as a Java Android app.

## What technologies do you plan to use?
We are going to use Swift to create the iOS app, Java for the Android app. Create an api with Express and MongoDB. We will create a front-end app using Angular.

## Feature list

I can add, update, delete, and view reminders.

Reminders can be associated with a geo-location.

When users enter an area, they can be notified of the reminder.

When users exit an area, they can be notified of the reminder.
