## Project Description
IOS app similar in design and feel to Instagram, but for sharing links like reddit. Links will use hash tags to be sorted, and users can choose to follow other users of specific #tags

## What outputs do they need?
Post information, and user profile information. Message system.

## What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
