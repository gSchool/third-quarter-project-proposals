# Galvanize Q3 Group Project Proposal

### Team Name: __ODBzzz__

### Group Members:
- George Flauta
- Keith Davis
- Lee Robinson
- Thomas Jones

### Project/Application Name: __Testing, Testing__

### Project Description:
As may be inferred by the name, _Testing, Testing_ is an educational platform masked as a challenge-based web, game app.  Using a computer interface, players would pit their knowledge of a subject or ability to perform a task against other users.   

### Who uses it?
The MVP audience for _Testing, Testing_ will be developers, who should be sufficiently familiar with the included code logic and TDD (Test Drive Design).  Beyond proof-of-concept, content for the _Testing, Testing_ platform will be increased to facilitate training or educational opportunities (e.g. schools, business training, friendly competition, etc)

### What outputs do they need?
Users will need to write (or correct) code to successfully pass TDD tests in order to progress.  Winners will receive visual confirmation of either winning or losing a challenge.  Additionally, winning a challenge will provide (dispense) a physical reward (details TBD).

### What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
As a web-based application, access to the Internet will be necessary; players will use a keyboard as the primary source of input.  An understanding of TDD would be helpful, but test failure codes will be provided to users.   

### What technologies do you plan to use?
- Arduino
- Raspberry Pi
- Photon wifi / ITFFF

### Libraries/frameworks used:
- TDD (Test Drive Design), Mocha/Chai
- AngularJs, Javascript
- Arduino_Machine_Language

### Feature list
- MVP
  1. Remote trigger for delivery (or dispensing) of reward.
  2. Develop front-end condition to trigger delivery system through completing or winning challenge.
  3. Using a coding interface, users will complete code challenges to trigger the reward.
- Stretch goals
  1. Create physical environment (using Raspberry Pi) for direct, face-to-face, head-to-head user challenges.
  2. Develop additional tests to expand platform to service wider range of user interest.
