## Project Description

The Mi Pride Dino team is submitting a project which is intended to help the user establish good habits. The user establishes goals/habits they would like to complete each day or at a set interval and hold themselves accountable with daily check-ins. We want to design a clean, contemporary UI with a UX that is non-judgmental and positive. The app will use communication that feels like a friend giving support and encouragement.

## Who uses it?
Millennials looking for a fun way to track changes to their lifestyles that improve their mental, physical, and/or emotional well being. People who enjoy GIFs.

## What outputs do they need?
Users need to be able to see if they've completed their goal(s) or not for a particular day, week, or month. If indicated, they will receive motivational media.

Users need to create goals, indicate which days they've completed their goals, and indicate an interest in receiving motivational media.
